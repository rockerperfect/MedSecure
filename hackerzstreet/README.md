# MedSecure Enterprise - HIPAA-Compliant Medical Record Exchange Platform

A secure, enterprise-grade web application for sharing medical records that fully demonstrates HIPAA compliance without using any external libraries.

## Enterprise Features

- **Advanced End-to-End Encryption**: AES-GCM encryption using Web Crypto API
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Second-factor verification for enhanced security
- **Comprehensive Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for patients, healthcare providers, and administrators
- **Detailed Audit Logging**: Complete tracking of all system activities for compliance
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout
- **Password Security**: Strength measurement, secure hashing with salting
- **Data Integrity**: Document signing and verification
- **Optimized Data Storage**: Indexed data for fast retrieval
- **Data Import/Export**: Backup and restore capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Enterprise UI that works on all devices

## Technical Implementation

This application is built entirely with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

No external libraries, frameworks, or dependencies are used, demonstrating that enterprise-level features can be implemented with native web technologies.

## Security Features

The application implements enterprise-grade security features:

1. **Strong Encryption**: Uses the Web Crypto API with AES-GCM for true cryptographic security
2. **Secure Password Storage**: PBKDF2 key derivation with high iteration counts and salting
3. **HMAC Signatures**: Data integrity verification using cryptographic signatures
4. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Time-based verification codes for two-factor auth
5. **Session Management**: Automatic expiry, inactivity timeout, and session refresh
6. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Immutable record of all system activities
7. **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockout after failed authentication attempts
8. **Secure Access Controls**: Tight permission restrictions based on user role

## HIPAA Compliance Features

The application adheres to HIPAA requirements:

1. **Access Controls**: Strict role-based permissions
2. **Audit Controls**: Complete logging of all access and actions
3. **Integrity Controls**: Data signing and verification
4. **Person/Entity Authentication**: Strong authentication mechanisms
5. **Transmission Security**: End-to-end encryption for all data

## Client-Side Architecture

The application uses a modular architecture:

- **Authentication Module**: User registration, login, and session management
- **Encryption Module**: Cryptographic operations for data security  
- **Data Store**: Client-side database with indexing and query capabilities
- **Audit Logger**: Comprehensive activity logging system
- **Records Module**: Medical record management and sharing
- **Application Core**: Coordination of all system components

## Running the Application

1. Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser
2. Register a new account (administrator, healthcare provider, or patient)
3. Use the interface to manage medical records and share them securely

## Browser Compatibility

The application requires a modern browser with support for:
- Web Crypto API
- localStorage/sessionStorage
- JavaScript Promises
- ES6+ features

Compatible browsers include recent versions of:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Apple Safari

## Developer Documentation

### Modules

1. **Auth.js**: Handles authentication, session management, and MFA
2. **Encryption.js**: Provides cryptographic functionality using Web Crypto API
3. **DataStore.js**: Client-side database with indexing and advanced querying
4. **AuditLogger.js**: Records all system activities for compliance
5. **Records.js**: Manages medical record operations
6. **App.js**: Main application coordination

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: User credentials → Auth Module → Session Token
2. **Record Creation**: User input → Encryption → DataStore → Audit Log
3. **Record Sharing**: User selection → Access Control → Recipient notification
4. **Record Access**: Authentication → Authorization check → Decryption → Display

## Production Considerations

For a true production environment, additional components would be implemented:

1. **Server-side API**: RESTful or GraphQL API for data persistence
2. **Database**: Properly secured database with encryption at rest
3. **Server-side Validation**: Additional verification of client inputs
4. **Backup System**: Automated backup procedures
5. **Monitoring**: System health monitoring and alerting
